Welcome!

This tutorial will help you to practice with the [pyalgotrading](https://github.com/algobulls/pyalgotrading/) package with the help of an example.

You will need an active and working [AlgoBulls](https://www.algobulls.com/) Account. Check out the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) section to ensure you have everything setup before you start the tutorial.

This tutorial will help you with the following:

1. Code your own simple strategy using the [pyalgotrading](https://github.com/algobulls/pyalgotrading/) package
2. Upload your strategy to the [AlgoBulls](https://www.algobulls.com/) Platform
3. Run Backtest / Paper Trade / Real Trade using your strategy
4. Fetch logs during runtime, see reports, view the statistics and see your order history

For point 1, you need a Python IDE of your choice. However, if you do not wish to code your own strategy, then check out our [pyalgostrategypool](https://github.com/algobulls/pyalgostrategypool) package to get a ready strategy for your use.

For points 2,3 and 4, you can use a Jupyter Notebook.

Check out the basic [structure](structure.md) of a strategy. This will give you a basic summary and the flow behind each method which you will code in the strategy.

Reach out to [AlgoBulls Support](mailto:support@algobulls.com) for any queries.
